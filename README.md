* Chingu Conqure Template Clone

Structure

 Explore the Conquer Template demo, then download it (FREE) to your computer

 Make files for your app, such as an index.html, stylesheet, and .js file.

> You may download the Conquer template and use its `index.html` for testing. 
> This will allow you to compare what you've implemented against the 
> screenshot we've provided. However, you'll need to come up with your 
> own implementation of the CSS and JS.
 
 Make sure you have HTML containers for each section. For instance a navigation, header, footer, sections, divs

 Footer section with your developer information

Style

 Cloning means to create a web page with a layout as identical as possible to the template.

> Fonts, colors, and images are not important. The layout of the web page
> on the other hand should be the same. A suggestion would be to compare
> the way the template looks face to face to the clone.
 
 Choose some images for your template sections at Unsplash or another free image/video site

 Which fonts and colors do you want to use? Add these and media queries (to look good on mobile) to your stylesheet, which you need to add to your index.html

 For the card sections of the page, categories, etc. decide on a layout strategy and use it consistently, such as CSS Grid and/or Flexbox

 Design your buttons and other elements. Remember to use a consistent design so buttons all look like buttons, links all look like links, etc.

Functionality

 Make your buttons scroll to the page sections. The scrolling that gracefully eases in instead of jumps is a good thing to try with JavaScript

 Implement a Parallax effect for your page.

> You are going to need to research how to write the JavaScript and CSS for 
> the PARALLAX effect. It is recommended, because it is an effect in high 
> demand! "Parallax" scrolling is when the background appears to move at 
> a different rate of speed, or in a different direction, than the rest 
> of the page.
Other

 Your repo needs to have a robust README.md
